# **Diseases Lexicon**   

**Introduction:**   
Diseases lexicon project is meant to compile the lexicon from diseases concepts present in UMLS Metathesaurus and SNOMED CT. The project also compiles a unique list of diseases and synonyms from both resources.

**Prerequisites:**   
Downloading and installation of UMLS Metathesaurus requires license (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/knowledge_sources/metathesaurus/). Please refer refer to https://github.com/CutaneousBioinf/LiteratureMiningTool/tree/master/ConceptMap for processing of UMLS Metathesaurus. We used SNOMED CT within UMLS Metathesaurs. The default installation doesn't include all the entities from SNOMED CT. For installing SNOMED CT within UMLS Metathesaurus, we need to select the required version of SNOMED CT during the installation process.  

---- RUN IN AN IDE ----
